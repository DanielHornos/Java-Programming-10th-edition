 * Chapter 1 Exercise 11:
 *      (Population projection) The U.S. Census Bureau projects population based on the following assumptions:
 *          - One birth every 7 seconds
 *          - One death every 13 seconds
 *          - One new immigrant every 45 seconds
 *      Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years.
 *      Assume the current population is 312,032,486 and one year has 365 days.
