 * Chapter 1 Exercise 13:
 *
 *      (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations)
 *      You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following 2 * 2 system of linear equation.
 *      Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
 *
 *          3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
 *          2.1x + .55y = 5.9
