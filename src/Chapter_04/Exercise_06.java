 * Chapter 4 Exercise 6:
 *
 *      (Random points on a circle)
 *      Write a program that generates three random points on a circle centered at (0, 0)
 *      with radius 40 and display three angles in a triangle formed by these three points
 *
 *      A random point on the circle can be generated using a random angle α
 *      x = r × cos(α) and y = r × sin(α)
