 *      (Count positive and negative numbers and compute the average of numbers)
 *      Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers, determines how many
 *      positive and negative values have been read, and computes the total and average
 *      of the input values (not counting zeros). Your program ends with the input 0. Display
 *      the average as a floating-point number.
