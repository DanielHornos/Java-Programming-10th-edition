 *      (Financial application: compute future tuition)
 *      Suppose that the tuition for a university is $10,000 this year and
 *      increases 5% every year. In one year, the tuition will be $10,500.
 *      Write a program that computes the tuition in ten years and the total
 *      cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition after the tenth year.
