/**
 * Chapter 5 Exercise 14:
 *
 *      (Compute the greatest common divisor)
 *      Another solution for Listing 5.9 to find the greatest common
 *      divisor of two integers n1 and n2 is as follows: First find d
 *      to be the minimum of n1 and n2, then check whether d, d-1, d-2, ..., 2, or 1
 *      is a divisor for both n1 and n2 in this order. The first such common divisor
 *      is the greatest common divisor for n1 and n2. Write a program that prompts the
 *      user to enter two positive integers and displays the gcd.
