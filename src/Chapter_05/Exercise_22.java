/**
 * Chapter 5 Exercise 22:
 *
 *      (Financial application: loan amortization schedule)
 *      The monthly payment for a given loan pays the principal and the interest.
 *      The monthly interest is computed by multiplying the monthly interest rate
 *      and the balance (the remaining principal). The principal paid for
 *      the month is therefore the monthly payment minus the monthly interest.
 *      Write a program that lets the user enter the loan amount,number of years,
 *      and interest rate and displays the amortization schedule for the loan.
 *      loan.
