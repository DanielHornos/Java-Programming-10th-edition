/**
 * Chapter 5 Exercise 23:
 *
 *      (Demonstrate cancellation errors) A cancellation error occurs when you are manipulating
 *      a very large number with a very small number. The large number may cancel out the smaller
 *      number. For example, the result of 100000000.0 + 0.000000001 is equal to 100000000.0.
 *      To avoid cancellation errors and obtain more accurate results, carefully select the order
 *      of computation. For example, in computing the following series, you will obtain more accurate
 *      results by computing from right to left rather than from left to right.
 *
 *      Write a program that compares the results of the summation of the preceding series,
 *      computing from left to right and from right to left with n = 50000
 *
