 *      (Occurrence of max numbers) Write a program that reads integers, finds
 *      the largest of them, and counts its occurrences. Assume that the input
 *      ends with number 0. Suppose that you entered 3 5 2 5 5 5 0; the program
 *      finds that the largest is 5 and the occurrence count for 5 is 4.
