/**
 * Chapter 5 Exercise 45:
 *
 *      (Statistics: compute mean and standard deviation) In business applications,
 *      you are often asked to compute the mean and standard deviation of data.
 *      The mean is simply the average of the numbers. The standard deviation
 *      is a statistic that tells you how tightly all the various data are
 *      clustered around the mean in a set of data. For example, what is the average
 *      age of the students in a class? How close are the ages? If all the students are
 *      the same age, the deviation is 0. Write a program that prompts the user to
 *      enter ten numbers, and displays the mean and standard deviations of these numbers
 *      using the provided formula
