/**
 * Chapter 6 Exercise 30:
 *
 *      (Game: craps) Craps is a popular dice game played in casinos. Write a program
 *      to play a variation of the game, as follows:
 *      Roll two dice. Each die has six faces representing values
 *      1, 2, ..., and 6, respectively. Check the sum of the two dice.
 *      If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (called craps), you lose; if the sum is 7 or 11 (called natural),
 *      you win; if the sum is another value (i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), a point is established.
 *      Continue to roll the dice until either a 7 or the same point value is rolled.
 *      If 7 is rolled, you lose. Otherwise, you win.
