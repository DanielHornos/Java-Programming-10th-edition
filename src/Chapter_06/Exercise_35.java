 * Chapter 6 Exercise 35:
 *
 *      (Geometry: area of a pentagon) The area of a pentagon can be computed using the following formula:
 *       Write a method that returns the area of a pentagon using the following header:
 *
 *          public static double area(double side)
 *
 *       Write a main method that prompts the user to enter the side of a pentagon and
 *       displays its area.
