/**
 * Chapter 6 Exercise 36:
 *
 *      (Geometry: area of a regular polygon)
 *      A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon in which all sides are of the same
 *      length and all angles have the same degree (i.e., the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular).
 *      Write a method that returns the area of a regular polygon using the following header:
 *
 *              public static double area(int n, double side)
 *
 *      Write a main method that prompts the user to enter the number of sides and the
 *      side of a regular polygon and displays its area.
