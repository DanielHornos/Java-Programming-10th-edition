/**
 * Chapter 7 Exercise 11:
 *
 *      (Statistics: compute deviation)
 *      Programming Exercise 5.45 computes the standard deviation of numbers.
 *      This exercise uses a different but equivalent formula to compute the standard deviation of n numbers.
 *      To compute the standard deviation with this formula, you have to store the individual
 *      numbers using an array, so that they can be used after the mean is obtained.
 *
 *      Your program should contain the following methods:
 *          - public static double deviation(double[] x)
 *          - public static double mean(double[] x)
 *
