/**
 * Chapter 7 Exercise 23:
 *
 *      (Game: locker puzzle) A school has 100 lockers and 100 students.
 *      All lockers are closed on the first day of school. As the students enter,
 *      the first student, denoted S1, opens every locker. Then the second student,
 *      S2, begins with the second locker, denoted L2, and closes every other locker.
 *      Student S3 begins with the third locker and changes every third locker
 *      (closes it if it was open, and opens it if it was closed). Student S4 begins
 *      with locker L4 and changes every fourth locker. Student S5 starts with L5 and
 *      changes every fifth locker, and so on, until student S100 changes L100.
 *      After all the students have passed through the building and changed the lockers,
 *      which lockers are open? Write a program to find your answer and display all open
 *      locker numbers separated by exactly one space.
 *
 *      (Hint: Use an array of 100 Boolean elements, each of which indicates whether a locker is open (true) or closed (false). Initially, all lockers are closed.)
 *       Created by Daniel Hornos Valiente on 8/28/16.
