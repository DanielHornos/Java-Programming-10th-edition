/**
 * Chapter 7 Exercise 24:
 *
 *      (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem)
 *      Coupon collector is a classic statistics problem with many practical applications.
 *      The problem is to pick objects from a set of objects repeatedly and find out
 *      how many picks are needed for all the objects to be picked at least once.
 *      A variation of the problem is to pick cards from a shuffled deck of 52 cards
 *      repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed before you see one of each suit.
 *      Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck before picking another.
 *      Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed to get four cards from
 *      each suit and display the four cards picked (it is possible a card may be picked twice).
