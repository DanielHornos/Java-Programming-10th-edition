/**
 * Chapter 7 Exercise 32:
 *
 *      (Partition of a list) Write the following method that partitions the list
 *       using the first element, called a pivot.
 *
 *            public static int partition(int[] list)
 *
 *       After the partition, the elements in the list are rearranged so that all the elements before
 *       the pivot are less than or equal to the pivot and the elements after the pivot are greater than the pivot.
 *       The method returns the index where the pivot is located in the new list. For example, suppose the
 *       list is {5, 2, 9, 3, 6, 8}. After the partition, the list becomes {3, 2, 5, 9, 6, 8}.
 *       Implement the method in a way that takes at most list.length comparisons.
 *       Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a list and displays the list after the partition.
 *       Here is a sample run. Note that the first number in the input indicates the number of
 *       the elements in the list. This number is not part of the list.
 *
