/**
 * Chapter 8 Exercise 17:
 *
 *      (Financial tsunami)
 *      Banks lend money to each other. In tough economic times, if a bank goes
 *      bankrupt, it may not be able to pay back the loan. A banks total assets
 *      are its current balance plus its loans to other banks.
 *      The diagram in Figure 8.8 shows five banks. The banks; current balances
 *      are 25, 125, 175, 75, and 181 million dollars, respectively.
 *      The directed edge from node 1 to node 2 indicates that
 *      bank 1 lends 40 million dollars to bank 2.
 *
 *      If a banks total assets are under a certain limit, the bank is unsafe.
 *      The money it borrowed cannot be returned to the lender, and the lender
 *      cannot count the loan in its total assets. Consequently, the lender may
 *      also be unsafe, if its total assets are under the limit. Write a program
 *      to find all the unsafe banks. Your program reads the input as follows. It
 *      first reads two integers n and limit, where n indicates the number of banks
 *      and limit is the minimum total assets for keeping a bank safe. It then reads
 *      n lines that describe the information for n banks with IDs from 0 to n-1.
 *      The first number in the line is the banks balance, the second number indicates
 *      the number of banks that borrowed money from the bank, and the rest are pairs of
 *      two numbers. Each pair describes a borrower. The first number in the pair is the
 *      borrowers ID and the second is the amount borrowed.
 *       For example, the input for the five banks in Figure 8.8 is as follows (note that the limit is 201):
 *
 *      5 - number of banks
 *      201 - minimum asset limit
 *
 *      Bank#0 Balance:  25  NumOfBanksLoaned: 2 BankID: 1 Amount: 100.5 BankID: 4 Amount:  320.5
 *
 *      Bank#1 Balance: 125  NumOfBanksLoaned: 2 BankID: 2 Amount:  40   BankID: 3 Amount:   85
 *
 *      Bank#2 Balance: 175  NumOfBanksLoaned: 2 BankID: 0 Amount: 125   BankID: 3 Amount:   75
 *
 *      Bank#3 Balance:  75  NumOfBanksLoaned: 1 BankID: 0 Amount: 125
 *
 *      Bank#4 Balance: 181  NumOfBanksLoaned: 1 BankID: 2 Amount: 125
 *
 *      The total assets of bank 3 are (75 + 125), which is under 201, so bank 3 is unsafe.
 *      After bank 3 becomes unsafe, the total assets of bank 1 fall below (125 + 40).
 *      Thus, bank 1 is also unsafe. The output of the program should be
 *
 *      Unsafe banks are 3 1
 *
 *      (Hint: Use a two-dimensional array borrowers to represent loans.
 *      borrowers[i][j] indicates the loan that bank i loans to bank j.
 *      Once bank j becomes unsafe, borrowers[i][j] should be set to 0.)
