 *      (Central city)
 *      Given a set of cities, the central city is the city that has the
 *      shortest total distance to all other cities. Write a program that
 *      prompts the user to enter the number of the cities and the locations
 *      of the cities (coordinates), and finds the central city and its total
 *      distance to all other cities.
