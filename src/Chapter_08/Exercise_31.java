/**
 * Chapter 8 Exercise 31:
 *
 *      (Geometry: intersecting point)
 *      Write a method that returns the intersecting point of two lines.
 *      The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by using the
 *      formula shown in Programming Exercise 3.25. Assume that (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
 *      are the two points on line 1 and (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) are on line 2.
 *      The method header is:
 *
 *      public static double[] getIntersectingPoint(double[][] points)
 *
 *      The points are stored in a 4-by-2 two-dimensional array points with (points[0][0],
 *      points[0][1]) for (x1, y1). The method returns the intersecting point or null if
 *      the two lines are parallel. Write a program that prompts the user to enter four
 *      points and displays the intersecting point. See Programming
 *      Exercise 3.25 for a sample run.
