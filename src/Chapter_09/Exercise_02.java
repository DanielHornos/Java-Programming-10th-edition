/**
 * Chapter 9 Exercise 2:
 *
 *      (The Stock class) Following the example of the Circle class in Section 9.2,
 *      design a class named Stock that contains:
 *
 *           ■ A string data field named symbol for the stock’s symbol.
 *           ■ A string data field named name for the stock’s name.
 *           ■ A double data field named previousClosingPrice that stores the stock price for the previous day.
 *           ■ A double data field named currentPrice that stores the stock price for the current time.
 *           ■ A constructor that creates a stock with the specified symbol and name.
 *           ■ A method named getChangePercent() that returns the percentage changed from previousClosingPrice to currentPrice.
 *
 *      Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class.
 *      Write a test program that creates a Stock object with the stock symbol ORCL,
 *      the name Oracle Corporation,and the previous closing price of 34.5.
 *      Set a new current price to 34.35 and display the price-change percentage.
