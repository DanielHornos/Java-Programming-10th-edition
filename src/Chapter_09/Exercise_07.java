/**
 * Chapter 9 Exercise 7:
 *
 *  (The Account class) Design a class named Account that contains:
 *
 *      ■ A private int data field named id for the account (default 0).
 *      ■ A private double data field named balance for the account (default 0).
 *      ■ A private double data field named annualInterestRate that stores the current interest rate (default 0).
 *          Assume all accounts have the same interest rate.
 *      ■ A private Date data field named dateCreated that stores the date when the account was created.
 *      ■ A no-arg constructor that creates a default account.
 *      ■ A constructor that creates an account with the specified id and initial balance.
 *      ■ The accessor and mutator methods for id, balance,and annualInterestRate.
 *      ■ The accessor method for dateCreated.
 *      ■ A method named getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns the monthly interest rate.
 *      ■ A method named getMonthlyInterest() that returns the monthly interest.
 *      ■ A method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account.
 *      ■ A method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account.
 *
 *   Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class.
 *   (Hint: The method getMonthlyInterest() is to return monthly interest, not the interest rate.
 *   Monthly interest is balance * monthlyInterestRate. monthlyInterestRate is annualInterestRate / 12.
 *   Note that annualInterestRate is a percentage, e.g., like 4.5%. You need to divide it by 100.)
 *
 *   Write a test program that creates an Account object with an account ID of 1122,
 *   a balance of $20,000, and an annual interest rate of 4.5%. Use the withdraw method to withdraw $2,500,
 *   use the deposit method to deposit $3,000, and print the balance, the monthly interest, and the date when
 *   this account was created.
