/**
 * Chapter 9 Exercise 12:
 *
 *      (Geometry: intersecting point)
 *      Suppose two line segments intersect. The two end-points for the first line segment
 *      are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and for the second line segment are (x3, y3) and (x4, y4).
 *      Write a program that prompts the user to enter these four endpoints and displays the
 *      intersecting point. As discussed in Program- ming Exercise 3.25, the intersecting point can
 *      be found by solving a linear equation. Use the LinearEquation class in Programming Exercise 9.11
 *      to solve this equation. See Programming Exercise 3.25 for sample runs.
