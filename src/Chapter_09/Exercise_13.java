/**
 * Chapter 9 Exercise 13:
 *
 *      (The Location class)
 *      Design a class named Location for locating a maximal value and its
 *      location in a two-dimensional array. The class contains public data
 *      fields row, column, and maxValue that store the maximal value and its
 *      indices in a two-dimensional array with row and column as int types and maxValue as a double type.
 *
 *      Write the following method that returns the location of the largest
 *      element in a two-dimensional array:
 *
 *      public static Location locateLargest(double[][] a)
 *
 *      The return value is an instance of Location.
 *      Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a two-dimensional
 *      array and displays the location of the largest element in the array.
 *
