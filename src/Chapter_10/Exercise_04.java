/**
 * Chapter 10 Exercise 4:
 *
 *      (The MyPoint class) Design a class named MyPoint to represent a point with x- and y-coordinates. The class contains:
 *      ■ The data fields x and y that represent the coordinates with getter methods.
 *      ■ A no-arg constructor that creates a point (0, 0).
 *      ■ A constructor that constructs a point with specified coordinates.
 *      ■ A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to a specified point of the MyPoint type.
 *      ■ A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to another point with specified x- and y-coordinates.
 *      Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class.
 *      Write a test program that creates the two points (0, 0) and (10, 30.5)
 *      and displays the distance between them.
 *
