/**
 * Chapter 10 Exercise 8:
 *
 *      (Financial: the Tax class) Programming Exercise 8.12 writes a program for computing taxes using arrays. Design a class named Tax to contain the follow- ing instance data fields:
 *       ■ int filingStatus: One of the four tax-filing statuses:
 *              0—single filer,
 *              1— married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er),
 *              2—married filing separately, and 3—head of household.
 *              Use the public static constants SINGLE_FILER (0),
 *              MARRIED_JOINTLY_OR_QUALIFYING_WIDOW(ER) (1),
 *              MARRIED_ SEPARATELY (2),
 *              HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD (3) to represent the statuses.
 *
 *       ■ int[][] brackets: Stores the tax brackets for each filing status.
 *       ■ double[] rates: Stores the tax rates for each bracket.
 *       ■ double taxableIncome: Stores the taxable income.
 *
 *       Provide the getter and setter methods for each data field and the getTax() method
 *       that returns the tax. Also provide a no-arg constructor and the
 *       constructorTax(filingStatus, brackets, rates, taxableIncome).
 *       Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class.
 *       Write a test program that uses the Tax class to print the 2001 and 2009
 *       tax tables for taxable income from $50,000 to $60,000 with intervals of $1,000
 *       for all four statuses. The tax rates for the year 2009 were given in Table 3.2.
 *       The tax rates for 2001 are shown in Table 10.1.
