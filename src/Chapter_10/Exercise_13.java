/**
 * Chapter 10 Exercise 13:
 *
 *      (Geometry: the MyRectangle2D class) Define the MyRectangle2D class that"
 *      "contains:"
 *      "■ Two double data fields named x and y that specify the center of the rec- tangle with getter and setter methods.
 *      (Assume that the rectangle sides are parallel to x- or y- axes.)"
 *      "■ The data fields width and height with getter and setter methods."
 *      "■ A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle with (0, 0) for (x, y) and"
 *      "1 for both width and height."
 *      "■ A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified x, y, width, and"
 *      "height."
 *      "■ A method getArea() that returns the area of the rectangle."
 *      "■ A method getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of the rectangle."
 *      "■ A method contains(double  x,  double  y) that returns true if the specified point (x, y) is inside this rectangle (see Figure 10.24a)."
 *      "■ A method contains(MyRectangle2D r) that returns true if the specified rectangle is inside this rectangle (see Figure 10.24b)."
 *      "■ A method overlaps(MyRectangle2D r) that returns true if the specified rectangle overlaps with this rectangle (see Figure 10.24c)."
 *
 *      "Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. Write a test"
 *      "program that creates a MyRectangle2D object r1 (new MyRectangle2D(2, 2, 5.5, 4.9)), displays its area and perimeter, and displays the result of r1.contains(3,  3), r1.contains(new  MyRectangle2D(4,  5,  10.5,"
 *      "3.2)), and r1.overlaps(new MyRectangle2D(3, 5, 2.3, 5.4))."
