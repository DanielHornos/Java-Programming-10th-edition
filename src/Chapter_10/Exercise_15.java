/**
 * Chapter 10 Exercise 15:
 *
 *      "*10.15 (Geometry: the bounding rectangle)
 *      A bounding rectangle is the minimum rectangle that encloses a set of points in a two-dimensional
 *      plane, as shown in Figure 10.24d. Write a method that returns a bounding rectangle for a set of
 *      points in a two-dimensional plane, as follows:"
 *
 *      "public  static  MyRectangle2D  getRectangle(double[][]  points)"
 *      "The Rectangle2D class is defined in Programming Exercise 10.13. Write a"
 *      "test program that prompts the user to enter five points and displays the bounding
 *      rectangleâ€™s center, width, and height. Here is a sample run:"
 *
 *      "Enter five points: 1.0 2.5 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
 *      "The bounding rectangle's center (5.0, 6.25), width 8.0, height 7.5"
