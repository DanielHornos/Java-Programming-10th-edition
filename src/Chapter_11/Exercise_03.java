/**
 * Chapter 11 Exercise 3:
 *
 *      (Subclasses of Account) In Programming Exercise 9.7, the Account class was
 *      defined to model a bank account. An account has the properties account number,
 *      balance, annual interest rate, and date created, and methods to deposit and withdraw
 *      funds. Create two subclasses for checking and saving accounts. A checking
 *      account has an overdraft limit, but a savings account cannot be overdrawn.
 *      Draw the UML diagram for the classes and then implement them. Write
 *      a test program that creates objects of Account, SavingsAccount, and
 *      CheckingAccount and invokes their toString() methods.
