/**
 * Chapter 12 Exercise 29:
 *
 *      (Replace words)
 *      Suppose you have a lot of files in a directory that contain words Exercisei_j,
 *      where i and j are digits. Write a program that pads a 0 before i if i is a
 *      single digit and 0 before j if j is a single digit. For example, the word Exercise2_1
 *      in a file will be replaced by Exercise02_01. In Java, when you pass the symbol *
 *      from the command line, it refers to all files in the directory (see Supplement III.V).
 *      Use the following command to run your program.
