/**
 * Chapter 14 Exercise 28:
 *
 *      (Random time)
 *      Modify the ClockPane class with three new Boolean
 *      properties hourHandVisible, minuteHandVisible, and secondHandVisible
 *      and their associated accessor and mutator methods.
 *      You can use the set methods to make a hand visible or invisible.
 *      Write a test program that displays only the hour and minute hands.
 *      The hour and minute values are randomly generated.
 *      The hour is between 0 and 11, and the minute is either 0 or 30,
 *      as shown in Figure 14.52b.
