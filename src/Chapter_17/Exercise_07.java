 *      the ObjectOutputStream. The file contains Loan objects. The Loan
 *      class in Listing 10.2 does not implement Serializable. Rewrite the
 *      Loan class to implement Serializable. Write a program that reads the
 *      Loan objects from the file and displays the total loan amount. Suppose
 *      you donâ€™t know how many Loan objects are there in the file,
 *      use EOFException to end the loop.
