/**
 * (Count the occurrences of numbers entered)
 * Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers and finds
 * the one that has the most occurrences. The input ends when the input
 * is 0. For example, if you entered 2 3 40 3 5 4 â€“3 3 3 2 0, the number 3
 * occurred most often. If not one but several numbers have the most occurrences,
 * all of them should be reported. For example, since 9 and 3 appear twice in the
 * list 9 30 3 9 3 2 4, both occurrences should be reported.
